    <string name="notes_library">This **Library** activity displays the users saved playlists and songs,
    while also providing an interface for searching through their own library as well as for new songs.
    \nI would like to implement a search interface into the app bar, but have used a simple SearchView
    here in the library for now.
    \nThe most pressing challenge is how to pull the list of songs and playlists from a database and generate
    the necessary views. The **ListView** looks the most promising in this regard.</string>
